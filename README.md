# ⚠️ The Repository of Eternal Confusion

**Disclaimer: I have no idea what I am doing.**

This is a NixOS configuration written by a creature fueled by panic and espresso. There is no logic here. There is no reason. There is only the eternal cycle of `nixos-rebuild switch`, the error message, and the subsequent screaming.

This entire configuration is a crime scene of copy-pasted snippets from Reddit threads, 4-year-old blog posts, and hallucinations induced by sleep deprivation. I do not know how the dependency resolution works. I assume it involves blood magic.

**WARNING**: This system state is held together by load-bearing whitespace and sheer audacity. I do not know why it builds, only that the Machine God smiled upon me during the last hash calculation.

## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Do you know what this code does?**
A: No.

**Q: Does it work?**
A: Sometimes. Usually when I'm not looking directly at it.

**Q: Should I use this as a reference?**
A: Absolutely not. This code was hammered out by a madman with a bloodstream consisting of 90% espresso and a misunderstanding of functional programming.

## ✨ Features Include

- Spaghetti code (Declarative style).
- Comments that lie.
- **Horrific amounts of AI slop** that I copy-pasted without reading.
